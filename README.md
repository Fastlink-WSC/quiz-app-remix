**Welcome to the Quiz app assignment**
====================

A basic quiz application with a focus on essential features and a minimalistic design, aiming to evaluate the understanding of a variety of topics in frontend web development.

**The Assignment**
------------------

The assignment you're about to tackle is a simplified version of a real-world quiz application, built using the A remix template we’ve prepared for you. This application is designed to be small and manageable, allowing you to focus on the project's core functionality while demonstrating your web development skills, adherence to web best practices, and proficiency in frontend web development.

**Data**
--------

The application will store quiz data locally, using a simple object structure and does not have a backend or an API integrated. However, you are welcome to use local storage in the browser, a simple SQLite database, your own backend or an API if you prefer.

**Best Practices**
------------------

Following best practices is crucial for developing high-quality, maintainable, and user-friendly web applications. Here are some of best practices we adhere to in our projects:

1.  **Code Organization and Readability:** Employ a modular and well-organised code structure to enhance maintainability. Use descriptive variable and function names, meaningful comments where appropriate, and proper indentation to make the code easy to understand and navigate.

2.  **Accessibility:** Minimise accessibility barriers by adhering to web accessibility guidelines. Ensure proper colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and alternative text for images to cater to users with disabilities.

3.  **Version Control:** Employ a version control system like Git to track changes. Regularly commit changes with meaningful commit messages to facilitate code reviews and traceability.

4.  **Responsiveness:** Ensure the application adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


By following these best practices, you can create a robust, user-friendly, and maintainable quiz app that demonstrates your proficiency in both front-end development and web development principles.

**Design**
----------

The design of the simple quiz app should prioritise simplicity, clarity, and accessibility. Here are some key design considerations:

You can find the reference design in this [figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/4AFir6BVBClc0CljOyxm1d/Web-App-Quiz-(Assignment)?type=design&node-id=3%3A3057&mode=dev&t=4aFDB9bggLvkmnAQ-1). You can use it as a reference for the design, but you are free to use your own design as long as it follows the design principles below.

**Colour Scheme:**

*   Employ a clean and uncluttered colour palette that compliments the quiz theme.

*   Use browser’s built-in colour contrasting tools to ensure readability of text and backgrounds .

*   Consider using colour-coding to indicate correct or incorrect answers.

*   **Bonus**: consider using custom properties in CSS/SASS to make them easier to change.


**Typography:**

*   Choose clear and readable fonts that are easy on the eye and suitable for the target audience.

*   Use appropriate font sizes for headings, body text, and button labels.

*   Maintain a consistent font style throughout the application.


**Layout and Hierarchy:**

*   Create a structured layout that guides users through the quiz experience.

*   Use clear visual hierarchy to prioritise important elements, such as the question, answer choices, and progress indicator.

*   Organise content effectively to avoid clutter and maintain a clean, uncluttered appearance.


**User Interface (UI) Elements:**

*   Design intuitive and user-friendly UI elements, such as buttons, input fields, and progress indicators.

*   Ensure responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

*   **Bonus**: Use appropriate animations and transitions to enhance the user experience without overwhelming the interface.


**Accessibility:**

*   Follow web accessibility guidelines to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.

*   Use proper colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and alternative text for images to cater to a wider audience.

*   Provide clear instructions and feedback to guide users throughout the quiz.


By carefully considering these design principles, you can create a visually appealing and user-friendly simple quiz app that enhances the overall learning experience for users.

As for the technical part, we highly recommend the use of SASS, following the [7-1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern) and the [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/) or you can use vanilla CSS if you prefer that. Using any other pre-processors, frameworks, component libraries are **strictly prohibited**.

**Development**
-------------------------------

**This is a Remix + Vite based app!**

📖 See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) for details.


Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
yarn build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`


**Submission and Deliverables**
-------------------------------

*   Source code pushed to a git repository and providing us with the link, or by simply forking this repo then opening a Pull request.

*   A `README.md` file with setup instructions, project overview, additional documentation, and any notable design decisions.


**Deployment (Bonus)**
----------------------

Deploying your Quiz application to a production environment demonstrates your ability to take a project from development to completion and make it accessible to a wider audience. It also shows your understanding of deployment best practices and your ability to ensure the application's stability and scalability.

While not mandatory, deploying your application would be a valuable addition to your submission and showcase your overall skills as a developer.

**Grading Criteria**
--------------------

*   **Functionality**: Your implementation of the user stories will be evaluated based on its correctness, completeness, and adherence to the provided specifications and requirements. Effective use of the Remix framework and its core features.

*   **Web Best Practices**: Your adherence to web best practices, such as code organisation, accessibility, and responsiveness.

*   **Styling**: Styling skill and use of Sass following best practices, styling consistently and reducing duplication. Responsive design and browser compatibility

*   **Error Handling**: Demonstrate clear error handling and user feedback for loading states and failures. All forms and user inputs must include proper validation.

*   **Code Quality**: How well-organised and properly documented the code through using naming conventions.

*   **React Proficiency**: Your proficiency in React, including component design, state management, and prop drilling.
